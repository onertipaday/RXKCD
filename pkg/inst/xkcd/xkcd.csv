We see the same things every day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.
B: And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.
B: This is very important, so I want to say it as clearly as I can:
B: FUCK.
B: THAT.
B: SHIT.

Mrs. Roberts spends her time developing for Ubuntu, and defacing the websites of people who make ""your mom"" jokes to her daughter. Elaine still stalks the net. She joins communities, contributes code or comments, and moves on. And if, late at night, you point a streaming audio player at the right IP at the right time - you can hear her rock out.

{{scribbled-out sidenote right: BLOGSPOT}}
Strawberry Banana Pancakes
Four pancakes filled with sliced fresh banana and crowned with cool strawberry topping, more [17] bananas and [23] whipped topping.
[17] Driven by a nameless fear, a whisper in the dark behind me, I flee ahead of I know not what. Whenver I turn, there's nobody behind me.  And yet someone is clearly stealing the ketchup. WHY?
[[The footnote is covered in fingerprints.]]
[23] My life is feeding,
fleeing,
fighting,
and
forgetting.
[[The above note is sandwiched in sideways in between the Stuffed French Toast and Ham and Egg Melt.]]
Rooty Jr.
A kids only [19] version of our house signature Rooty Tooty. One scrambled egg, one strip of bacon, one pork sausage link and one fruit-topped buttermilk pancake.
[19] The decision not to hyphenate ""kids only"" is likely connected to the omission of the serial comma. I wonder if the author is British. I wonder if he sleeps at night.
[[The following passages are have a red substance underneath them, probably ketchup.]]
Rise 'N Shine
Two eggs, toast and hash browns served with your choice [21] of two strips of bacon or two pork sausage links.
[21] {{illegible}} rent a storage unit. Sleep there. Fill it with pancakes. Leave.
Stuffed French Toast
Cinnamon raisin French [18] toast stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling, topped with cool strawberry or your choice of fruit compote and whipped topping.
[18] Nightmares again. I wake up covered in sweat, and what appears to be a thin sheen of maple syrup
{{Handwritten, underlined}} WHO IS MOHAWK GIRL?
[[Slanted 90 degrees left]]
Ham & Egg Melt
Grilled sourdough bread stuffed with ham, scrambled eggs, Swiss and American cheeses. [20]
[[At normal orientation]]
[20] Ordered this in at an IHOP in Rochester, New York. There was blood on the floor. Some of it was mine.
[[Comic strip]]
Enough with your pancakes.
Enough with your GOD DAMN pancakes.
The Big Steak Omlette
Tender strips of steak, hash browns, {{redacted}} tomatoes and Cheddar cheese. Served [22] with house salsa.
[22] Woke up in Las Vegas.  They're closing the Star Trek Experience today.  The IHOP up the strip had pancake platters named after various states.
None of them sounded like home.

[[Lord of the Rings. A mass of colored lines weaves back and forth across the chart, representing various characters. Sauron is represented by a huge black bar at the bottom with branches for nazgul, orcs, etc. Major locations (Moria) and plot points (the breaking of the fellowship) are marked. Gandalf, especially at the beginning, jumps all over the map in a short time. Eagles appear and then disappear a couple of times. Treebeard's line is flat except for the march to Isengard. At the end, the ship to the West drifts off into a corner.]]

[[Star Wars (original trilogy). This chart is simpler. Luke, mostly accompanied by R2-D2, joins and parts from other sets of characters. There's a dotted alternative path on Jabba's line for the special edition. Yoda appears about halfway through (where Luke's Jedi training is marked). All the surviving lines group up at Endor except for Vader, the Emperor, Luke, and Lando; after the climactic duel, the latter two join the rest.]]

[[Jurassic Park. The human characters are in black; dinosaurs are in red. Dilophosaurus appears briefly to eat Nedry and then fades out again. The three raptors are together at the beginning, but split up about halfway through. One has a dotted portion of line between ""locked up"" and ""escapes."" In the meantime, they cut off the lines of Arnold and Muldoon. The raptor lines all end when t-rex's swoops down to meet them at the end, and all the surviving humans leave together.]]

[[12 Angry Men. The lines are labeled Juror 1 through Juror 12. They are all perfectly horizontal and parallel.]]

[[Primer. Three lines start on the left labeled Abe, Aaron, and Granger. They enter a mass of scribbling. Somewhere vaguely towards the end, three lines emerge and fade out, all labeled with question marks.]]

((Label in the center of main map.))
Updated Map of Online Communities
Size on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the 
Spring and Summer of 2010

[[Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]]

[[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is ""Facebook"" -- with large states in the southeast of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.

A peninsula on the southwest, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the southeast of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the southwest part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.

The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.

In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmvile and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.

To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.

East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)

To the southwest if Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]]

[[An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and 
b
. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]]

[[The northeastern third of Gossip
Political
Tech Blogs island is another inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.]] 

((Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.))
ABOUT THIS MAP
Communities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some paring of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.

Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leafing reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).

Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wiipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.

Person: So, are you guys out of the woods?
Second Person: We don't know.
Person: Well, did the treatment work?
Second Person: We don't know.

[[The diagram shows a simple highway.  Starting at the bottom, with diagnosis for five lanes, the road travels through a cloud of treatment, after which two lanes disappear, and three continue.  Later on, there's another offramp labeled 'cancer ""comes back""', which loops back into the treatment cloud.  Otherwise, the highway enters a later cloud called survive.]]
I always assumed that when you got cancer, they gave you a prognosis, then treated you, and at the end of treatment either you beat it or you died.
And I knew sometimes it ""recurred,"" which I assumed meant back to square one.
But that's turned out not to be quite right.

[[Back to the two people.]]
Second Person: Once most cancers spread out into your body, they're incurable.
Second Person: If your 10-year prognosis is 60%, that means a 40% chance that some cancer will slip past the treatment and get out.

Second Person: So they kill all the cancer they can find, and then you're a ""survivor.""  But your odds are still 60%.

[[The frame zooms just to show the second person.]]
Second Person: They can't scan for individual cancer cells.  The only way to know if it worked is to wait for tumors to pop up elsewhere.
Second Person: If you go enough years without that happening then you were in the 60%.

[[The frame shows both people again.]]
Second Person: And often the first sign is a cough or bone pain.
Second Person: So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry that every ache and pain is the answer to the question ""Do I make it?""

"978","http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/citogenesis.png","Citogenesis","11","978","","2011","","Citogenesis","Where Citations Come From:

Citogenesis Step #1
Through a convoluted process, a user's brain generates facts. These are typed into Wikipedia.
[[A guy with short hair sits at a desk, typing on a laptop.]]
Guy: (typing) The ""scroll lock"" key was designed by future Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a college project.

A rushed writer checks Wikipedia for a summary of their subject.
[[A woman with a ponytail sits at a desk, typing on a desktop.]]
Woman: (typing) US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, (Nobel Prizewinner and creator of the ubiquitous ""scroll lock"" key) testified before Congress today...
Step #2

Surprised readers check Wikipedia, see the claim, and flag it for review. A passing editor finds the piece and adds it as a citation. 
[[A man sits on a couch with a laptop in his lap, typing.]]
Man: Google is your friend, people. (typing) <ref>{{cite web|url=
Step #3

Step #4
Now that other writers have a real source, they repeat the fact.
[[A flow chart, with ""Wikipedia citation"" in the center. The word ""Wikipedia"" is in black, the word ""citations"" is white with a red background. 
A black arrow leads from ""brain"" to ""Wikipedia.""
A black arrow labeled ""words"" leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""careless writers,"" and a red arrow labeled ""citations"" leads back to ""Wikipedia citations."" 
A black & red arrow leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""cited facts"" which leads to ""slightly more careful writers,"" which leads to ""more citations,"" which leads back to ""Wikipedia"" (all black & red arrows).]]
References proliferate, completing the citogenesis process.
